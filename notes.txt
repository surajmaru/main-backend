*we make changes in the "package.js => type: "common.js"=> "module"  "



*on linus/macos we can do => "touch" on terminal to create files.
*on windows we can do "New-Item index.js -ItemType File" to create files or folders through terminal.


*then we did this " 


 "scripts": {
    "dev": " nodemon src/index.js"
  },
  
  
  " in our package.js file.


*then when we psuh our code on the github we dont see the "node_modules" and ".env" file on the github its because we have written those file names in the .gitignore file so thats why it will ignore those files and push everything else.

*we set up git and github with my code.


*then we configured "prettier" extension and installer using "npm i -D prettier"
*and made a ".prettierrc" and ".prettierignore" file to write some files in it which we want prittier to ignore.
